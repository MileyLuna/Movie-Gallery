# Movie - SAGA


## Description
Duration: 10 hours

Most codes and required imports were provided for us. What's left to do is:

### Home / List Page

This view is completed already! It displays all of the movies in the movie database. 

- TODO: When a movie poster is clicked, a user should be brought to the `/details` view for that movie.

### Details Page

This should show all details **including ALL genres** for the selected movie, including title, description, and the image, too! Use Sagas and Redux to handle these requests and data.

- TODO: The details page should have a `Back to List` button, which should bring the user to the Home/List Page

> Base functionality does not require the movie details to load correctly after refresh of the browser.

## Installation
